3. Game Logic and Progression 

Progression is gated by a "Hack-to-Learn" system, where knowledge itself is the primary 
resource. 

Knowledge Acquisition (K-Map System) 

Stage 
Logic Gate & Server Check 
Player Action Required 

LOCKED 
Command fails with "not found" 
error. 

N/A. 

DISCOVERED 
Boolean Check: 
\text{KNOWLEDGE\_FRAGM
ENTS\_COLLECTED} 

Find and copy \ge 3 unique 
Knowledge Fragments from 
enemy/mission filesystems. 

SYNTHESIS 
Boolean Check: 
\text{SYNTHESIS\_MODULE\_
CREATED} 

Write a NexusScript module 
that correctly compiles the 3 
fragments. The man page 
unlocks. 

INTEGRATED (Functional) 
Boolean Check: 
\text{CONCEPT\_VALIDATED
} 

Successfully complete a 
high-level mission that requires 
the concept of the command 
(e.g., simultaneous actions for 
thread spawn). Command is 
fully executable. 

Mission Logic (PvP & CTF) 

Missions are defined by a server-side Boolean Goal. 

Mission Type 
Goal / Server Logic 
Strategic Requirement 

PvP: Resource Acquisition 
\text{WINNER} = 
(\text{ACQUIRED\_FILES} \ge 
3) 

Teams must hack opponents to 
steal 3 critical files OR 
defend/counter-attack to 
recover their own. 

PvE/PvP: CTF 
\text{WINNER} = 
(\text{TARGET\_ROOT} \land 
\text{FLAG\_EXFILTRATED}) 

First team to breach the final 
network layer (which is 
dynamically patched between 
rounds) and copy the flag wins. 

Team Collaboration 
\text{K-Map Update} = 
\text{SUCCESS} 

Players can use the share 
$fragment @team command 
to instantly integrate knowledge 
fragments among teammates. 

4. Implementation Framework (Backend & Client) 

The architecture is designed for cross-platform mobile and web play, with all logic residing on 
the server. 

Backend Server (Logic & State) 

Component 
Technology Recommendation Primary Function 

Framework 
Node.js (Express) or Python 
(Django/Flask) 

Hosts the core game logic and 
API endpoints. 

Database 
(MongoDB or PostgreSQL) 
Stores all persistent data: 
Player state, K-Maps, Missions, 
and Module files. 

APIs 
REST: For state management 
(login, save, load). 
WebSocket: For real-time PvP, 
log streams, and live command 
execution feedback. 

Ensures the single source of 
truth for all game logic is the 
server. 

Execution Flow 
Client \rightarrow WebSocket 
\rightarrow Server-Side VC 
Logic \rightarrow Server 
Response \rightarrow Client. 

The server executes all 
NexusScript and game logic; 
the client is a display terminal. 

Cross-Platform Client (Interface) 

Component 
Technology Recommendation Primary Function 

Game Engine 
Phaser 3 (or similar framework 
like PixiJS) 

Creates a single, responsive 
interface that works on web and 
mobile (via wrappers like 
Capacitor). 

Interface 
Simple CLI/Terminal UI: 
Provides the visual experience, 

Component 
Technology Recommendation Primary Function 
Fixed-size terminal area, simple 
input component optimized for 
mobile keyboards, and a static 
sidebar for VC status 
(RAM/CPU/Credits). 

focusing on text and minimalist 
design for low bandwidth and 
high readability. 

 

I can certainly optimize those instructions. To effectively use an AI code platform like Jules, the 
instructions need to be modular, focus on interface requirements, and explicitly define the 
custom language elements. 
Here are the optimized, structured instructions for an AI platform to build the starting framework 
for the Code Nexus game. 

Optimized AI Framework Instructions (Code Nexus) 

The following instructions are segmented for rapid, iterative development, focusing on the core 
functional components first. 

Module 1: Core System and NexusShell (Foundation) 

GOAL: Create the basic execution environment and CLI interface. 

Component 
Instruction 
Output Requirement 

Project Setup 
Initialize a cross-platform 
(Python/JS preferred) project 
structure for a simulated CLI 
environment. 

Base file structure, main 
execution loop (while True: 
get\_input()), and command 
handler function 
(execute\_command). 

VC State 
Define a Player class and a 
VC_State object to store: level, 
credits, ram_max, cpu_max, 
and a dictionary for 
kmap_state (all commands 
initialized to LOCKED). 

Player class methods for 
update_xp and check_kmap. 

NexusShell Parser 
Implement the input parser. 
Use space as the primary 
token delimiter. Variable 
recognition must be strictly 
enforced via the $ prefix. 

The parse_input(text) function 
must return a list of tokens, 
identifying the command and its 
arguments. 

Core Commands 
Implement the simplest 
commands: ls, cat, and print. 
Use local file system I/O only. 

Executable functions for 
cmd_ls(path) and cmd_cat(file). 

Module 2: NexusScript Language & Objects 

GOAL: Implement the custom scripting engine and object interaction. 

Component 
Instruction 
Output Requirement 

NexusScript Interpreter 
Create a basic runtime 
environment capable of 
interpreting the custom 
NexusScript syntax: func, set 
$var = new Object(), if () {}, and 
for in {}. 

A run_script(module_name) 
function that can execute a 
loaded script line by line, 
handling control flow logic. 

IP_Object Class 
Define the IP_Object class. Its 
constructor must take 4 integer 
parameters (e.g., 10 0 0 1). 

The IP_Object class with 
properties and a ping() method. 

Component 
Instruction 
Output Requirement 

Include a simple ping() method 
that returns TRUE or FALSE 
randomly for simulation. 

set Command 
Implement the set command for 
variable assignment and object 
instantiation. It must correctly 
route "new IP..." to the 
IP_Object constructor. 

The cmd_set(tokens) function 
handling both primitive values 
and new Object() calls. 

Module Editor 
Implement the edit 
$module_name function, 
allowing players to write and 
save multi-line NexusScript 
code to the VC's virtual file 
system. 

A simple text input loop for the 
editor and a file-saving function. 

Module 3: Gating and Freemium Constraints 

GOAL: Integrate the core progression and monetization logic. 

Component 
Instruction 
Output Requirement 

Command Gating 
Implement the K-Map Check 
inside the execute_command 
function. If a command is not 
found in the K-Map or is set to 
LOCKED, return the error 
"Command not found." 

A central 
check_unlock(cmd_name) 
function that gates all advanced 
commands. 

Fragment Logic 
Create a 
scan_file_for_fragment(content) 
function. This function must 
search the input string for a 
hardcoded declaration tag (e.g., 
"CMD_DECLARE: PIVOT") 
and, if found, update the 
player's K-Map state for that 
command to DISCOVERED. 

The scan_file_for_fragment 
function linked to the cat and 
copy commands. 

F2P Constraints 
Define two modes: F2P and 
VIP. In F2P mode, introduce a 
5-second time.sleep() delay 
into a placeholder hashcrack 
function to simulate a time-sink. 

A global boolean flag is_vip and 
conditional logic inside 
time-sensitive functions. 

man Page Integration 
Implement the man [command] 
help system. It should only 
display content if the 
command's state in the K-Map 
is at least DISCOVERED. 

The cmd_man(command) 
function utilizing the pre-written 
command database content. 

 

It would be impractical and likely result in an overwhelming amount of text to post all previous 
chat outputs from the entire conversation into a single block. 
However, I can provide the final, comprehensive summary that compiled all the design decisions 
for the Code Nexus game into a single, cohesive document. This includes the monetization, 
language, logic, and implementation details discussed in the latter half of our conversation. 
If you need the very first outputs (like the initial freemium model and basic language design), I 
can retrieve those as well, but the final summary below should capture the complete and refined 
design.

Technology Recommendation Primary Function 

Backend Framework 
Node.js (Express) or Python 
(Django/Flask) 

Hosts the core game logic and 
API endpoints. 

APIs 
REST: For state management 
(login, save, load).

Response \rightarrow Client. 

The server executes all 
NexusScript and game logic; 
the client is a display terminal. 

 

That's a great idea for documentation! A Man (Manual) page format is perfect for a CLI-based 
game, offering concise and structured help. 
Here is the database of core NexusScript commands and syntax in a simplified Man-page 
format, broken down by function and tiered by player progression. 

NexusScript Command Database (Man Format)

MAN PAGE: scan 

NAME     scan - perform network discovery and port enumeration 
SYNOPSIS     scan [IP_Object or address] 
DESCRIPTION     Identifies open ports and services running on the target. Returns a collection 
of Port_Object results. Speed is limited by NIC Hardware. 
OPTIONS     --service         Attempts to identify the specific software version of the running 
service.     --subnet         Scans the entire subnet range (e.g., scan 192 168 1 0 --subnet 24). 
EXAMPLES     scan $target_ip --service     set $ports = scan 10 0 0 5 

MAN PAGE: run

Requires the correct target system/service version. Success results in gaining root access. 
EXAMPLES     $cve_77.deploy($target_ip "win_server_v2" $shell_payload) 
    $zero_day_v1.deploy($unknown_target "auto" $data_exfil) 

These instructions are optimized for an AI platform like Jules, breaking down the requirements 
for a scalable backend server (using a common web framework) and a single, responsive 
client built with a cross-platform game engine. 

Phase 3: Backend Server and Cross-Platform Client 

GOAL: Establish the persistent game state (backend) and a single, responsive client interface 
accessible on mobile and web. 

Module 7: Backend Server (Node.js/Express or Python/Django) 

GOAL: Create a robust API to manage player data, game state, and real-time PvP sessions. 

Component 
Instruction 
Output Requirement 

Server Framework 
Initialize a backend server 
using Node.js with Express or 
Python with Django/Flask. 
This choice must support 
WebSocket for real-time 
communication. 

Basic API structure with routing 
and environment configuration. 

Database Schema 
Design a schema for persistent 
player data. Key 
collections/tables must include: 
Players (ID, \mathbb{C}, C-XP, 
ram_max, is_vip, K-Map 
JSON), Missions (ID, type, 
difficulty), and Modules (Player 
ID, script content). 

Schema definition file (e.g., 
ORM models or Mongoose 
schema) to store all critical 
game state data. 

REST API (State 
Management) 

Implement core REST 
endpoints for persistent data: 
POST /api/login, GET 
/api/player/state, PUT 
/api/player/kmap (for saving 
K-Map updates), and POST 
/api/mission/complete (to award 
\mathbb{C} and C-XP). 

Functional CRUD endpoints to 
manage player and mission 
data. 

Real-Time PvP Handler 
(WebSocket) 

Implement a WebSocket 
server (e.g., Socket.io or 
Django Channels) to handle 
dynamic PvP sessions. This 
channel will manage live 
NexusScript execution status 
and the shared LAN State. 

A persistent, authenticated 
WebSocket connection 
endpoint. 

Module 8: Cross-Platform Client (Phaser or Similar) 

GOAL: Create a single, responsive client using a mobile/web-friendly engine (like Phaser 3) 
that communicates solely with the backend API. 

Component 
Instruction 
Output Requirement 

Game Engine Choice 
Utilize Phaser 3 (or a similar 
engine like PixiJS or 
Godot/JavaScript export) for 
the client. The output must be 
easily packaged for 
Android/iOS (via 
Cordova/Capacitor) and run 
directly in a web browser. 

Basic HTML/JS structure with 
the chosen engine initialized 
and running. 

Interface Design (Simple UI) Design a single, fixed-size 

interface with three main 
responsive areas: 1) 
NexusShell Input/Output (the 
primary terminal), 2) VC Status 
Sidebar (displaying RAM, 
CPU, \mathbb{C}, Level), and 
3) Module Editor Panel (for 
edit command use). 

A responsive layout that adapts 
correctly to both portrait mobile 
and landscape web views. 

Terminal Input Component 
Implement the primary input 
field where players type 
NexusScript commands. This 
component must have a simple, 
tactile input area suitable for 
mobile keyboards. 

A JavaScript component that 
captures input and sends it as a 
string to the backend's REST 
API or WebSocket. 

Server Communication Layer Integrate both REST and 

WebSocket communication 
within the client. Use REST for 
initial state loading and saving, 
and WebSocket for real-time 
PvP interaction, command 
responses, and log streams. 

A dedicated client-side service 
to handle API calls and manage 
WebSocket connections. 

Module 9: Integration and Command Execution Flow 

GOAL: Define the final flow for executing player commands, ensuring the server handles the 
game logic, not the client. 

Component 
Instruction 
Output Requirement 

Command Execution Flow 
The client MUST NOT execute 
NexusScript logic. The flow is: 
Client Input \rightarrow 
Server API Endpoint 
\rightarrow Server VC Logic 
\rightarrow Server Response 
\rightarrow Client Output 
Update. 

A POST /api/cmd/execute 
endpoint that receives the 
command string, runs the 
NexusShell Parser on the 
server, and returns the resulting 
text output and any state 
changes (e.g., \mathbb{C} 
update). 

Real-Time PvP Flow 
Use the WebSocket for 
time-critical commands. When 
a player executes scan or 

WebSocket handler functions to 
manage and broadcast updates 
to the PvP LAN state. 

Component 
Instruction 
Output Requirement 

exploit, the command is sent 
via WebSocket. The server 
calculates the result, updates 
the shared LAN State 
(database), and sends the 
result back to all players in the 
session in real-time. 

Client-Side Visual Feedback Implement visual feedback for 

slow operations. The client 
should display a non-blocking 
"Executing..." or "Processing 
(VIP Speed)" animation while 
waiting for the server's 
response to an operation like 
hashcrack. 

UI elements that display status 
messages based on server 
response latency. 

 

This is a crucial design decision. The Freemium model must strike a perfect balance: offering 
genuine educational value to free players while providing compelling quality-of-life and efficiency 
improvements for subscribers, avoiding a "pay-to-win" environment that undermines the learning 
core. 
Here is the design for a Freemium Code Nexus using a VIP Subscription Model. 

3. The Freemium Model: Learn Free, Hack Efficiently 

The core philosophy is: All knowledge and core gameplay mechanics are free. Time and 
quality-of-life improvements are paid. 

A. Free-to-Play Tier: The Freelancer 

The Free-to-Play (F2P) experience is the complete game. A dedicated player can achieve max 
level, complete all missions, and develop cutting-edge modules. The cost is time, effort, and 
efficiency. 

Free-to-Play Restriction/Time Sink

Resource Management: Free VCs have lower 
starting RAM/CPU/Bandwidth caps, forcing 
players to write highly efficient, compact 
NexusScript modules to avoid system crashes 
(out of memory error). 

Slower Credential Cracking Time 
Algorithm Efficiency: The hashcrack 
command has a longer real-time delay (e.g., 
5-minute cooldown between attempts), 
incentivizing players to optimize their custom 
wordlist/ruleset modules to crack the hash on 
the first try. 

Limited Remote Access/Instance Time 
Focus and Planning: Tutorial VMs/mission 
targets expire faster (e.g., 30-minute window). 
This demands free players master the mission 
sequence and minimize time-wasting 
experimentation. 

No Module Automation 
Direct Scripting Interaction: Free players 
must manually run and monitor their modules, 
or write complex nested scripts, reinforcing the 
need to understand every step of the hacking 
process. 

Manual System Diagnostics 
Deep System Knowledge: Checking logs, 
analyzing target system data, and monitoring 
their own VC for defense requires manually 
querying NexusShell objects (e.g., 
VC.log.read(3)). 

B. VIP Subscription Tier: The Architect 

The VIP subscription, or "Architect Tier," removes the artificial time and efficiency barriers, 
providing tools that automate mundane tasks and offer deeper analysis. Crucially, it does not 

provide unique functions or pwn buttons. 

Architect VIP Feature 
Benefit / Player Value 
Core Learning Still Required 

Automated Command 
Synthesis (A-CS) 

Simple Interface UI: A custom 
Graphical interface overlay that 
generates complex, 
well-formed NexusScript 
commands and functions based 
on simple drag-and-drop or 
checklist inputs. Saves typing 
and debugging time. 

Player must still understand the 
function logic (which objects 
and parameters are needed). 

Quantum Core VC Upgrade 
Higher VC Resource Caps: 
Substantially increases the max 
RAM/CPU/Bandwidth on the 
player's VC. Allows for running 
larger, less-optimized scripts 
and concurrent missions 
without system slowdowns. 

Player still needs to write the 
Module code; they just have 
more resources to run it. 

Background Module 
Execution 

Automated Control: Allows 
the player's modules (e.g., an 
automated defense script or a 
long-running brute-force attack) 
to run in the background while 
they pursue other missions or 
log off. 

Player must successfully code 
and debug the module first. 
The VIP feature only automates 
the running of a successful 
module. 

Real-Time Module Debugger Extra Tool: Provides a visual, 

step-by-step trace of a 
NexusScript module as it 
executes, highlighting variable 
values and object states. 
Greatly reduces debugging 
time for complex scripts. 

Player must still analyze the 
trace to find the logical error in 
their code. 

Mission Asset Repository 
Premium Resources: Grants 
access to pre-generated, 
large-scale resources like 
massive dictionaries for 
cracking, detailed virtual 
network maps for high-level 
targets, and archived historical 
CVE data (mission solutions). 

Player must still integrate 
these assets into their working 
script to solve the puzzle. 

C. In-App Purchases (One-Time Boosts) 

Beyond the subscription, small one-time purchases can be offered to both F2P and VIP players 
that are purely for cosmetics or minor, consumable boosts: 

●​ VC Skins/Themes: Custom colors, font styles, and sounds for the NexusShell. (Purely 

cosmetic). 

●​ Module Slot Expansion: A permanent (but small) increase in the number of concurrent 

scripts a player can have saved, encouraging larger module libraries. 

●​ Cred-Boost: A small, consumable item that provides a temporary (24hr) multiplier on 

Credits (\mathbb{C}) earned from missions. (Allows faster hardware upgrades, but not 
software knowledge). 

4. Balancing the Progression Loop 

The success of the model rests on maintaining the difficulty of late-game challenges for both 
player types: 

1.​ Late-Game Difficulty: High-level missions should revolve around Zero-Day simulation 

(writing custom exploits) or complex network traversal (Pivoting). These challenges 
cannot be solved by VIP automation; they require pure, player-written code logic and 
creativity. 

2.​ PvP Balance: In PvP hacking duels, the outcome should be determined by the quality, 

efficiency, and resourcefulness of the player-coded Attack and Defense Modules, 
not by VC hardware stats. While a VIP player can execute slightly faster, a clever F2P 
player with a highly optimized, small-footprint script should always be able to defeat a VIP 
player with a large, poorly-coded script. This keeps the core learning skill supreme. 

3.​ Free Player Pacing: The amount of Credits (\mathbb{C}) earned by F2P players must 

be sufficient to purchase all necessary core software modules and eventually max out 
the basic VC hardware, ensuring that progression is slow but certain, preventing 
frustration. 

That's the most challenging part of the project—integrating the complex logic. Building on Phase 
1, these instructions for an AI platform like Jules focus on implementing the advanced 
mechanics, the PvP environment, and the final logic gates. 

Phase 2: Advanced Mechanics and Logic 
Implementation 

GOAL: Implement multi-threading, advanced command execution, and the dynamic PvP 
environment with victory conditions. 

Module 4: Advanced Scripting and Object Interaction 

GOAL: Enable complex, high-level code execution and resource management. 

Component 
Instruction 
Output Requirement 

Parallel Processing 
Implement the thread spawn 
command. Use the underlying 
execution environment 
(Python's multiprocessing or JS 
web workers) to simulate 
parallel script execution, 
respecting the cpu_max limit of 
the player's VC. 

A 
cmd_thread_spawn(module_na
me) function that runs a script 
module asynchronously. 

Resource Monitoring 
Integrate a resource check into 
the run_script loop. Scripts that 
exceed the ram_max property 
of the VC_State must be 
terminated with an "Out of 
Memory" error. 

Logic to dynamically calculate 
and check a script's simulated 
RAM usage against the 
VC_State before and during 
execution. 

Exploit Object 
Define the Exploit_Object class. 
Include the critical 
deploy(target_ip, 
target_service) method. The 
method's success must be 
determined by a Boolean 
check against the 
target_service.version property. 

The Exploit_Object class and 
the logic for the deploy method 
returning TRUE only if version 
numbers match. 

Knowledge Synthesis Logic Refine the K-Map update logic. 

A command's state should 
change from DISCOVERED to 
INTEGRATED only after the 
player has provided a minimum 
of \mathbf{3} unique fragments 
and successfully compiled them 
into a single, valid .kns file. 

A function 
synthesize_knowledge(cmd_na
me) that validates the three 
Boolean prerequisite states 
before updating the K-Map. 

Module 5: PvP and Dynamic Network Environment 

GOAL: Create the temporary, strategic multiplayer battlegrounds and victory conditions. 

Component 
Instruction 
Output Requirement 

Dynamic LAN Generation 
Create a 
generate_pvp_lan(team_list) 
function. This function must 
assign random, 
non-internet-routable IP 
addresses to all participating 
player VCs and set up a 
temporary network topology. 

A dictionary representing the 
temporary LAN, mapping player 
IDs to their assigned IP and 
making them discoverable by 
the scan command. 

Mission File Logic 
Implement the logic to scatter 
and track mission objective 
files. Randomly place 
\mathbf{3} unique files (file_A, 
file_B, file_C) on the 
filesystems of the players of the 
opposing team. 

A server-side object that tracks 
the current location and 
ownership of the \mathbf{3} 
objective files. 

Acquisition/Recovery 
Implement the copy command 
for remote file transfer. A 
successful copy of an objective 
file from an opposing VC is an 
Acquisition. If a player copy's 
their own file back, it's a 
Recovery (both count toward 
the victory condition). 

Logic within the cmd_copy 
function to update the central 
objective file tracker. 

Victory Condition 
Implement the core PvP victory 
check. The game session ends 
when the first team's Boolean 
Goal evaluates to TRUE: 
\mathbf{\text{WINNER} = 
(\text{TEAM\_ACQUIRED\_FIL
ES} \ge 3)}. 

A persistent check loop that 
monitors the file tracker and 
triggers the end-of-round 
sequence. 

Module 6: VIP Quality-of-Life Features 

GOAL: Finalize the features that provide value to the subscription model without enabling 
pay-to-win. 

Component 
Instruction 
Output Requirement 

Automated Defense 
Implement the VIP command 
vc.auto_defend on. When this 
flag is set and an attack is 
detected while the player is 
offline, the system must 
automatically execute the 
player's highest-ranked 
defense script once. 

A server-side check that 
triggers a script execution 
based on the vc.auto_defend 
flag and an incoming connect 
or exploit attempt. 

Trace Mode (VIP) 
Enhance the run command for 
VIP users: run $module --trace. 

Conditional logic inside the 
run_script loop that only 

Component 
Instruction 
Output Requirement 

This should print the value of all 
active variables after every line 
of script execution, providing a 
powerful, time-saving 
debugging tool. 

executes the detailed variable 
logging if the is_vip flag is 
TRUE. 

 

That's the final piece of the core design! Let's expand the NexusScript language with features 
necessary for complex, late-game scripting and integrate the premium functionalities exclusive 
to the Architect VIP Tier. This ensures the language supports advanced cybersecurity 
concepts like parallel processing, remote tunneling, and specialized exploit development. 

7. Advanced NexusScript (Level 15+ & VIP Tier) 

These advanced features are unlocked either through high-level progression (Level 15+) or are 
exclusive quality-of-life additions for the VIP Architect Tier. 

A. Core Advanced Functions (High-Level Progression) 

These commands are essential for complex missions requiring Post-Exploitation and Pivoting 
techniques. 

Command/Object 
Syntax Example 
Core Function Logic 
Learning Concept 

pivot 
pivot 
$compromised_server 
$target_subnet 

Uses the compromised 
server as a proxy to 
launch a scan or ping 
command against a 
previously unreachable 
internal network 
($target_subnet). 

Pivoting: Bouncing 
attacks off an internal 
asset to bypass 
perimeter defenses. 

persist 
persist $root_access 
"backdoor module" 

Leaves a small, 
low-CPU module that 
attempts to re-gain root 
access if the target 
system reboots or the 
connection is lost. 

Maintaining Access: 
Setting up command 
and control (C2) or 
persistent shells. 

cleanup 
cleanup $target_server 
logs 

Executes a script to 
virtually scrub logs and 
remove traces of the 
last session, reducing 
the risk of being 
discovered by a rival 
player or in-game AI 
defense. 

Covering Tracks: 
Essential step in the 
professional 
pen-testing cycle. 

raw 
raw send $target_ip 
$data_packet 

Allows the player to 
bypass the high-level 
Service_Object 
methods and inject raw 
data into the virtual 
network stack. The 
data must be perfectly 
formatted. 

Low-Level 
Programming: 
Bypassing 
application-layer 
security to exploit 
weaknesses at the 
transport layer. 

B. Parallel Processing & Resource Control (Hardware Dependent) 

These commands directly utilize the upgraded VC hardware (CPU Cores and RAM) for 

high-performance scripting. 

Command/Object 
Syntax Example 
Functionality 
VC Requirement 

thread spawn 
set $t1 = thread spawn 
"scan module" $ip_list 

Executes the specified 
script ("scan module") 
as a separate, parallel 
process. 

Requires Multiple CPU 
Cores; 
resource-intensive 
scripts may fail. 

thread sync 
thread sync $t1 $t2 
Pauses the main script 
execution until two or 
more parallel threads 
have completed their 
tasks. 

Teaches Concurrency 
and Synchronization 
in multi-threaded 
programming. 

mem alloc 
mem alloc 512mb 
"temp buffer" 

Explicitly allocates a 
block of RAM for large 
operations (like 
cracking a massive 
dictionary). Failure to 
allocate enough causes 
a crash. 

Teaches Memory 
Management: Critical 
for avoiding the 
low-RAM constraint of 
the F2P tier. 

C. VIP Tier Exclusive NexusScript Functions (Architect Tier) 

The Architect Tier unlocks automation and complex debugging features that save significant 
real-world time but do not grant access to unique "win" buttons. 

VIP Function 
Syntax Example 
Architect VIP Benefit F2P Alternative (Time 

Sink) 

auto_deploy 
auto_deploy 
$exploit_module 
$network_map 

Automatically attempts 
the module against 
every vulnerable target 
identified in the map 
without manual 
interaction or input. 

F2P must use a 
custom-coded for loop 
module with manual 
error handling for each 
individual target. 

log.realtime 
log.realtime stream 
$target_ip 

Opens a live, streaming 
view of the target's 
virtual activity logs and 
error messages as the 
attack executes. 

F2P must manually use 
log.read after an attack 
and often deal with 
delayed log delivery. 

trace.var 
trace.var 
$exploit_module 
$pass_var 

Sets a silent breakpoint 
that monitors and prints 
the value of a specific 
variable ($pass_var) 
only when it changes. 

F2P must manually 
insert print statements 
throughout their code 
and rerun the module 
multiple times to debug. 

vc.auto_defend 
vc.auto_defend on 
Automatically executes 
the player's 
highest-ranked defense 
module when an 
incoming PvP attack is 
detected while the 
player is offline. 

F2P must rely on their 
last manually activated 
defense script or be 
logged in to initiate 
defense. 

By separating these functionalities, the game maintains its learning focus: 

●​ F2P Players learn efficiency and logic by solving problems with minimal resources and 

writing the required loops/automation themselves. 

●​ VIP Players gain speed and quality-of-life by automating the tedious parts, allowing 

them to focus immediately on the high-level challenges like Zero-Day creation and 
complex multi-threading logic. 

That's the heart of the system. Let's expand on the core Logic and Main Functions of the 
Code Nexus game, focusing on how the Virtual Computer (VC) processes commands, 
manages objects, and executes the player's NexusScript modules. 

6. Logic and Main Function Design 

The system runs on a simplified, layered logic model that simulates a real operating system and 
network stack, allowing for complex emergent gameplay while maintaining the easy-to-use 
NexusScript interface. 

A. The NexusShell Command Parser 

The first layer of logic is how the VC interprets what the player types. 

1.​ Input Parsing: The shell uses spaces to divide the player's input into tokens: \text{Input} 

\rightarrow \text{Token 1 (Command/Object)} | \text{Token 2 (Target/Method)} | \text{Token 
3+ (Parameters)} 

○​ Example Input: set $ip = new IP 10 0 0 1 
○​ Parsed: set (Command) | $ip (Variable) | = (Assignment) | new IP (Object 

Constructor) | 10 0 0 1 (Parameters) 

2.​ Function Dispatch: The parser determines if the first token is a Core Command (ls, 

scan, set) or a Variable/Object Method Call ($router.connect). 

○​ Core Command: The VC's built-in kernel executes the command logic directly. 
○​ Method Call: The system looks up the object's class (IP, Router, Exploit) and 

executes the specific method (connect, scan, deploy) defined within that object. 

3.​ Error Handling (Logic Feedback): The parser provides immediate, simple feedback for 

invalid syntax, teaching the player the correct format: 

○​ Syntax Error: "Error: Invalid parameter count for scan. Usage: scan [IP]" 
○​ Object Error: "Error: Method connect is not available on Object IP. Try a 

Service_Object." 

B. Core Function: Object-Oriented Network Stack 

The most critical function is how the VC simulates network interaction through the custom 
Object Architecture. Every interaction is a transaction between objects, which maps directly to 
real-world network layers. 

NexusScript Object 
Real-World Analog Analogy 
Main Function Logic 

IP / Network 
Network Layer (Layer 3) 
Address Resolution: The core 
function is to resolve the 
address and manage the virtual 
latency (simulated ping time) 
based on the player's NIC 
hardware. 

Port / Service 
Transport/Application Layer 
(Layer 4/7) 

State Management: Tracks if 
the port is open/closed/filtered 
and manages the running 
service version (which 
determines which 

NexusScript Object 
Real-World Analog Analogy 
Main Function Logic 
Exploit_Objects will work). 

Exploit 
Payload Execution 
Vulnerability Check & Code 
Injection: When 
$exploit.deploy() is called, the 
system checks if the target 
Service_Object version 
matches the vulnerability 
defined in the $exploit module. 
If matched, the logic flips the 
target.access_level to root or 
user. 

Firewall 
Security Appliance 
Rule-Set Evaluation: When an 
attack is initiated, the target's 
Firewall_Object checks the 
attacker's IP and method 
against its internal rules. If a 
rule is hit, the attack is aborted, 
or an Intrusion Detection 
System (IDS) alert is 
generated. 

C. Main Function: The Module Execution Loop 

When a player runs a script using run $module_name, the VC initiates the following loop, 
managing resources and checking for failure states: 

1.​ Resource Check: The system verifies the script's complexity (size, length of loops) 

against the VC's current RAM limit. If exceeded, the script is immediately halted with an 
Out of Memory error. 

2.​ Execution: The NexusScript commands are executed sequentially. 
3.​ CPU/Time Accounting: Each command consumes a small amount of virtual time and a 

portion of the VC's CPU Load. 

○​ Free players: Have lower CPU thresholds, meaning a complex script will run slower 

and risk the VC overheating/detection. 

○​ VIP players: Have higher thresholds, allowing for faster and more complex 

execution. 

4.​ Error Handling & Learning: If a logical error occurs during a mission (e.g., an exploit 

fails), the system returns a simple ERROR_OBJECT to the player's session. 

○​ The player must then use a specific command like target_log read error_object to 

get the simulated, educational reason for the failure (e.g., "Authentication failed: 
Invalid credentials provided to FTP service"). 

5.​ Completion & Reward: If the script successfully meets the mission's objective (e.g., 

flipping a remote server's access_level to root and exfiltrating the data), the loop ends, 
and the player is awarded Credits (\mathbb{C}) and Experience Points (XP). 

This logical structure ensures that players learn the Penetration Testing Methodology (Recon 
\rightarrow Vulnerability \rightarrow Exploit \rightarrow Pivot) by requiring them to chain the 
correct sequence of object interactions. 

This design creates a dynamic, engaging, and highly replayable learning environment where 
knowledge itself is the key resource, combining PvE learning with competitive PvP strategic 
hacking. 

8. Experience, Mission Logic, and Network Generation 

The core of the game is a dynamic, persistent, and player-influenced virtual network. 

A. Network and Target Generation Logic 

The game world is composed of two primary environments: 

1.​ Static PvE Mission Blocks: Fixed, pre-designed networks (e.g., "Level 3 Data Center") 

controlled by the AI. These are the primary source of early-game Credits (\mathbb{C}) 
and Knowledge Fragments. The difficulty is constant and scales by mission level. 

2.​ Dynamic PvP Lan Zones: Temporary, session-based networks where players or teams 

face off. The architecture of these networks is dynamically generated based on the 
average Player Level and VC Hardware rating of the participating teams. 

Target Parameter 
Generation Logic 
Player Influence/Learning 

IP Addresses/Subnets 
Randomly assigned within a set 
block (e.g., 10.x.x.x) to ensure 
no memorization. 

Requires players to use scan 
and ping for reconnaissance 
every match. 

Open Ports/Services 
Determined by the Complexity 
Level of the mission. Higher 
levels expose more diverse and 
obscure services. 

Forces players to utilize a wider 
array of Service_Object 
methods and Exploit_Object 
types. 

Firewall/Defense 
Based on the Difficulty Tier 
and the Defending Team's 
setup rules. Simple missions 
have basic DROP rules; 
advanced missions use 
IDS/Honeypots. 

Teaches Evading Detection 
and Log Analysis (using 
target_log read). 

Exploits 
The AI system logically checks 
player Exploit_Object attempts 
against the target's simulated 
vulnerability version (e.g., if 
target runs "FTP v2.1," "Exploit 
V2.1" works). 

Rewards players for accurate 
and targeted use of their exploit 
arsenal. 

B. Mission Types and Victory Logic (Boolean Goals) 

Missions are defined by their Boolean Goal, a server-side flag that, when set to TRUE, ends 
the round and awards the victor. 

1. Team vs Team (PvP) — Resource Acquisition 

Setup: Two teams (Alpha and Bravo) are spawned on a dedicated LAN. Critical mission files 
are scattered across the filesystems of the opposing team's players (e.g., one file on Player A, 
one on Player B, one on Player C). 

Mission Goal: \text{WINNER} = (\text{ACQUIRED\_FILES} \ge 3) 
Offense: A team wins the round by hacking members of the opposing team's VC, locating the 
file, and using the copy command to exfiltrate 3 unique files. 
Defense: Teams must proactively detect incoming attacks, deploy their defense modules (using 
vc.auto_defend or manual scripts), and even counter-attack to recover their own stolen files. A 
recovery is treated as an acquisition for the winning goal. 
Logic Advancement: Rounds proceed over time. If the time limit is hit, the team with the most 
acquired/recovered files wins. 

2. Team vs Target (PvE/PvP) — Capture The Flag (CTF) 

Setup: Multiple teams (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie) compete to be the first to hack a single, highly 
fortified AI-controlled target. 

Mission Goal: \text{WINNER} = (\text{TARGET\_ROOT} \land \text{FLAG\_EXFILTRATED}) 
Objective: The target is protected by multiple layers (e.g., Firewall \rightarrow Proxy Server 
\rightarrow Web Server \rightarrow Database). Each layer requires a unique set of skills 
(scanning, tunneling, SQL injection). 
\text{ROUND 1 GOAL} = \text{PROXY\_SERVER\_COMPROMISED} (First team to pivot off 
the Proxy Server wins the first knowledge fragment). 
\text{ROUND 2 GOAL} = \text{DATABASE\_ACCESS} (The database contains the final Flag 
File). 
Logic Advancement: The server controls the difficulty by dynamically patching vulnerabilities 
between rounds. A successful exploit in Round 1 may be patched in Round 2, forcing teams to 
develop new exploit modules. 

C. Team Collaboration and Reward System 

1.​ Shared Knowledge: A critical function is the ability to share hard-won Knowledge 

Fragments. A team member who finds a new fragment can use the share $fragment 
@team command. This instantly integrates the fragment into their teammates' K-Map, 
allowing all members to work on the command's Synthesis stage simultaneously. 

2.​ Specialized Roles (LAN Setup): 

○​ Offense Specialist: Focuses on developing and using Exploit_Object and raw 

commands to breach the perimeter. 

○​ Recon Specialist: Focuses on efficient scan and pivot modules to map the enemy 

LAN. 

○​ Defense Specialist: Focuses on Firewall and vc.auto_defend to secure their 

team's local environment. 

3.​ Bonus Reward: The winning team in any mission (PvP or CTF) receives a guaranteed 

Bonus Knowledge Fragment that is not available in standard PvE play (e.g., a fragment 
for a new Zero-Day Exploit Object). This encourages high-stakes competition and 
accelerates the winners' progression. 

I've compiled the discussed logic and game mechanics into a simple, multi-step set of starting 
instructions. This provides a roadmap for implementing the Code Nexus game. 💡 

Phase 1: Core System Implementation (The 
Foundation) 

This phase focuses on building the minimal viable environment required to run the game and 
validate the core mechanics. 

Step 1: Design and Implement the Virtual Computer (VC) Kernel and 
NexusShell 

1.​ VC State Machine: Define the core player data object (the VC) to track status: Player 

Level, \mathbb{C} (Credits), C-XP, VC Hardware Specs (RAM/CPU/NIC), and the core 
Knowledge-Map (K-Map) state. 

2.​ NexusShell Parser: Implement the command parser logic. It must correctly tokenize 

input using spaces as delimiters and recognize variable usage with the $ prefix. 

3.​ Core Command Execution: Hard-code the immediate execution logic for the starting 

commands: ls, cat, ping, set, and run. 

Step 2: Implement NexusScript Syntax and Module Editor 

1.​ Scripting Engine: Create the interpreter for NexusScript functions (func, if, for). Use 

simple bracket syntax ({}) for blocks and space-separated arguments for functions (e.g., 
$obj.method(arg1 arg2)). 

2.​ Module Editor: Implement the basic edit command interface with saving/loading 

functionality, allowing players to write and store their first simple scripts (modules). 

Step 3: Implement Core Object Architecture and Boolean Logic 

1.​ Object Classes: Define the initial classes for network objects: IP_Object and 

Service_Object. 

2.​ Server Logic: Implement the core functions for scan and connect/login. When a player 

uses scan, the system must use Boolean logic to determine if the target's virtual firewall 
allows the action. 

3.​ Progression System: Implement the C-XP system that awards points based on 

successful command execution and mission completion. 

Phase 2: Freemium, Gating, and Acquisition 

This phase integrates the monetization and knowledge-gating strategies. 

Step 4: Implement Freemium Tiers and Resource Constraints 

1.​ F2P Constraint Logic: Set initial low caps on F2P VC resources (CPU/RAM). Implement 

a time-delay on resource-intensive actions (e.g., hashcrack) to create the time-sink 

constraint. 

2.​ Architect VIP Tier Logic: Introduce the VIP subscription check. If active, lift the resource 

caps, remove time delays, and grant access to the Trace Mode for the run command. 

Step 5: Design and Gate the Knowledge-Map (K-Map) 

1.​ Initial Lockout: Ensure all advanced commands (pivot, thread spawn, raw) are initially 

set to LOCKED in the K-Map. The NexusShell must return the "Command not found" 
error if used. 

2.​ Fragment Discovery Logic: Design the game files to contain easily parsable 

Knowledge Fragments (e.g., text containing "CMD_DECLARE: pivot"). Implement the 
VC kernel logic to scan copied files for these fragments. 

3.​ Synthesis and Validation: Implement the Boolean Server Logic gates for advanced 

command unlocking. Require players to collect \ge 3 fragments and successfully run a 
Synthesis Module before a command's Man Page is available. 

Phase 3: Dynamic Missions and PvP 

This phase brings the system to life with dynamic content and competitive multiplayer. 

Step 6: Create the Mission Generation and Reward System 

1.​ Target Generation: Implement a script that procedurally generates PvE targets (IP, open 

ports, service versions, firewall rules) based on the target difficulty level. 

2.​ Reward Logic: Integrate the reward system: Successful mission completion grants 

\mathbb{C} and a guaranteed, unrepeatable Knowledge Fragment. 

Step 7: Implement PvP and Team Combat Logic 

1.​ Dynamic LAN Creation: Design a system to spin up a temporary, isolated network 

instance for each PvP match, populating it with the VCs of all participating players. 

2.​ Acquisition Goal Logic: Implement the PvP objective: Define a small set of files on 

defending players' VCs. Track the Boolean Goal for round victory: \text{WINNER} = 
(\text{ACQUIRED\_FILES} \ge 3). 

3.​ Team Collaboration: Implement the share command, which bypasses the Fragment 

Discovery logic and immediately updates a teammate's K-Map. 

Step 8: Finalize Defense and Counter-Attack Mechanics 

1.​ Defense Integration: Ensure players can code and deploy their custom defense modules 

and utilize the vc.auto_defend VIP command. 

2.​ Counter-Attack: Define the logic for recovering stolen files, making the defense an active 

part of the winning goal. 

That sounds like an ambitious and engaging concept! A multiplayer hacking learning game with 
a custom object-oriented shell could be a fantastic way to teach programming and cybersecurity 
concepts. 
Here's an overview, initial feature set, and development plan to get you started. 

Game Overview: Code Nexus 

The game, let's call it Code Nexus, is an MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online 
Role-Playing Game) focused on the competitive and cooperative development of software and 
hardware hacking modules. 

●​ Core Loop: Players start with a minimal, low-power Virtual Computer (VC) and a basic 

shell interface. They complete missions to earn Credits (\mathbb{C}), which are spent on 
upgrading VC hardware (CPU, RAM, Network Bandwidth) and purchasing/writing new 
software/scripting modules. Progress unlocks more complex missions and deeper 
access to the game world's virtual network. 

●​ Learning Focus: The core mechanism of the game is the custom scripting interface. 

Players must learn real programming concepts (object orientation, data types, control 
flow) to progress. 

●​ Genre: Educational/Hacking Simulation/MMORPG. 
●​ Setting: A near-future digital landscape where rival factions (corps, collectives, 

governments) vie for data and influence. 

Core Features and Design 

1. The Virtual Computer (VC) and Custom Interface 

The Virtual Computer (VC) is the player's core asset and interface. 

●​ The Shell: The Nexus CLI 

○​ Interface: A custom Command Line Interface (CLI), similar to Bash or 

PowerShell in look and feel. 

○​ Core Concept (Object-Oriented Function): Every action in the game—from 

running a scan to attacking a server—is a function call that operates on an object. 

■​ Syntax Example: [function] [target_object] [parameters] 
■​ scan network 192.168.1.0/24 (The scan function operates on the network 

object.) 

■​ attack target_server --module="Bruteforce_v1.2" (The attack function targets 

target_server using a module as a parameter.) 

○​ Custom Scripting: Players don't just use pre-built commands; they write their 

own modules (scripts) in a simplified, in-game, object-oriented language (e.g., 
NexusScript). These modules are essentially custom functions that chain built-in or 
acquired commands together to automate complex tasks, like an attack sequence 
or a defensive firewall check. 

●​ Upgradeable Hardware: | Hardware Component | Function/Impact | Start Level | Max 

Level | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | | CPU Cores | Determines Script Execution Speed and 
maximum concurrent processes. | 1 Core | 16+ Cores | | RAM (Memory) | Determines 
the complexity/size of modules you can load and run. | 1GB | 64GB+ | | Network Card 
(NIC) | Determines Scan Speed, Attack Data Rate, and Ping Latency to targets. | 10 

Mbps | 1 Gbps+ | 

2. Player Progression and Learning 

●​ Leveling System: Players level up by successfully completing missions, writing complex, 

efficient code modules, and engaging in player-vs-player (PvP) activities. 

○​ Low Level: Access to basic I/O, variable declaration, simple control flow (if/else). 

Missions focus on information gathering and simple network traversal. 

○​ Mid Level: Unlocks object creation/instantiation, function definition, and 

access to advanced network protocols/objects (e.g., TCP/IP stack objects). 
Missions involve bypassing firewalls and early encryption. 

○​ High Level: Unlocks multi-threading/parallel execution (tied to CPU upgrade), 

polymorphism/inheritance for module design, and complex cryptography 
objects. Missions involve large-scale data breaches or defense of critical 
infrastructure. 

●​ The Learning Atmosphere: 

○​ Code Documentation Object: A built-in object like help [command/module] that 

provides clear, simple explanations of the underlying programming or networking 
concept (e.g., explaining polymorphism when a player tries to upgrade a module). 

○​ Tutorial Missions: Carefully designed initial missions that force players to use core 

programming concepts like loops and conditional statements to progress. 

3. Multiplayer Gameplay (PvP & PvE) 

●​ PvE (Player vs. Environment): Missions 

○​ Contract System: Players accept contracts (missions) from various in-game 

organizations for Credits (\mathbb{C}). 

○​ Mission Types: Data Retrieval, Server Sabotage, Security Patching (for 

defense-minded players), and Network Mapping. 

○​ Dynamic Targets: Targets should be procedurally generated, virtual server 

networks with different OS "flavors," security settings, and digital assets. 

●​ PvP (Player vs. Player): Hacking Duels 

○​ Module Battles: Players can "hack" each other's VCs. The battle is a duel of 

modules—one player's Attack Module vs. the other's Defense Module 
(Firewall/IDS). 

○​ Real-Time Scripting: Players can monitor the battle output in the Nexus CLI and 

make on-the-fly adjustments or deploy counter-scripts. Victory is awarded to the 
player whose module is more efficient, less resource-intensive, or better coded to 
exploit a security hole (bug) in the opponent's defense module. 

○​ Staking: Players can stake Credits (\mathbb{C}) on duels. 

Development Plan: Phase 1 (Minimum Viable Product - 
MVP) 

Phase 1 focuses on building the core engine and the minimum necessary features to prove the 
concept and the learning loop. 

Stage 1: Core Engine & Single-Player Shell 

1.​ Develop the Nexus CLI Engine: Create the custom interpreter for the in-game scripting 

language (NexusScript). 

○​ Must support: Variables, Basic Math, Control Flow (if/else, for/while loops). 
○​ Define core Object Types: Network, Server, File, Module. 

2.​ Build the VC Interface: A basic terminal-style interface for the player. Implement the 

three starting hardware components (CPU, RAM, NIC). 

3.​ Implement Basic Core Functions: scan, connect, ls (list files), cat (view file contents), 

and run (execute a module). 

Stage 2: Initial Progression and PvE 

1.​ Implement Hardware Upgrades: Allow the player to spend a placeholder currency to 

upgrade the starting hardware. 

2.​ Design the Module Editor: A simple in-game text editor where players write, save, and 

debug NexusScript modules. 

3.​ Create 5 Tutorial Missions: Missions must guide the player to: 

○​ Use the scan and connect functions. 
○​ Write a module that uses a loop to try a list of passwords (Basic Brute-force). 
○​ Use an if/else statement to handle a successful vs. failed connection. 

4.​ Credit System: Implement the Credits (\mathbb{C}) currency earned from missions. 

Stage 3: Multiplayer Foundation 

1.​ Basic Server Infrastructure: Set up a central server to manage player profiles and game 

state. 

2.​ Implement Player-to-Player PING: The only allowed initial PvP interaction is the ability 

to run a latency check (ping [player_IP]). 

MVP Goal: 

A player can boot up their VC, write a basic module using loops and conditionals, successfully 
run it to complete a simple network-hacking mission, and upgrade their starting CPU using the 
earned credits. 
Would you like to dive deeper into the design of the NexusScript language itself, or focus on 
expanding the mission and progression ideas? 💻 

I'd be glad to expand on the NexusScript coding interface, focusing on features that make it 
robust, engaging for a multiplayer learning environment, and visually appealing within the CLI 
framework. This expansion adds features for debugging, team collaboration, and hardware 
interaction. 🛠️ 

5. Expanded NexusScript Coding Interface Features 

The interface must be more than just a terminal; it needs to be a fully functional coding and 
collaboration environment that lives within the Virtual Computer (VC).

That's an excellent direction! Focusing on a complex yet simple, feature-rich design grounded in 
real-world cybersecurity processes will make Code Nexus a highly effective learning tool. 
Here is the expanded design, integrating real-world hacking methodology and a scalable 
mission structure. 

1. The NexusShell Language & Tool Simulation 

The core of the game is the NexusShell interface and its object-oriented custom language, 
NexusScript. This system is designed to simulate the core function of real-world tools without 
requiring players to master the full syntax complexity of languages like C++ or Python.

B. Simulated Hacking Tools 

NexusScript will have built-in system objects that simulate the function of real-world tools. 
Players must learn the correct sequence and parameters (like in the real world of penetration 
testing).

Takes a captured hash 
(from a mission) and 
attempts to crack it 
based on a 
dictionary/ruleset (or 
custom player-written 
rule script). 

2. Scalable Mission Design and Progression 

Missions are structured around the phases of a real-world penetration test: Reconnaissance, 
Scanning/Vulnerability Analysis, Exploitation, and Post-Exploitation 
(Pivoting/Maintaining Access). 

A. The New Player Tutorial (The LAN Confinement) 

This phase serves as a mandatory, single-player tutorial teaching the absolute basics of the 
NexusShell. 

1.​ Phase 1: Minimal Resource (The Terminal) 

○​ Goal: Access a file on the local machine. 
○​ Action: Player is limited to ls (list files) and cat (read file) commands. Teaches file 

system basics. 

○​ Reward: Unlocks the IP_Object and the ping command. 

2.​ Phase 2: Network Discovery (The LAN) 

○​ Goal: Pwn/control 3 simple devices on the local network (e.g., a printer, a 

thermostat, a file server). 

○​ Action: Player must use ping and the basic scan command to find the devices. 

They use a single, hardcoded simple exploit function (e.g., exploit_default_pass) to 
gain root access. 

○​ Reward: Unlocks the Module Editor (scripting), the for loop function, and the 

ability to purchase CPU upgrades (improving module execution speed). 

3.​ Phase 3: The Gateway (The Firewall) 

○​ Goal: Bypass a simple Network Firewall Object to gain access to the external 

network (PvP and main PvE world). 

○​ Action: The player must write their first NexusScript module using the newly 

unlocked for loop to automate the attack or circumvent a simple rule-set, thus 
learning why automation is critical. 

○​ Completion: The player is now Level 1 and enters the main game world. 

B. Mid-Game and End-Game Scaling 

Missions are sourced through a dynamic Contract Board, where difficulty scales based on the 
player's highest completed tier and the complexity of their acquired/developed modules. 

Mission Tier 
Target Complexity 
Vulnerability Focus 
Scaling Mechanism 

Tier 1 (Trainee) 
Small business server, 
simple web page, IoT 
device. 

Default Credentials, 
basic Buffer 
Overflows (simulated 
by oversized string 
inputs). 

Requires simple for 
loops and the first 
Exploit_Object type. 

Tier 2 (Operator) 
Financial Kiosk, 
Mid-level Corporate 
Network (multiple 
subnets). 

Known CVEs 
(simulated: patching 
systems leaves old 
versions with flaws), 
SQL Injection. 

Requires multi-stage 
NexusScripts (Recon 
\rightarrow Exploit 
\rightarrow Pivot). 
Requires RAM 
upgrades for large 
scripts. 

Tier 3 (Master) 
Major Corporate 
Server, Government 
Systems, Rival Faction 
VC. 

Complex Privilege 
Escalation, Zero-Day 
Simulation, Custom 
Firewall/IDS modules. 

Requires Object 
Inheritance in 
modules, multiple 
concurrent processes 
(CPU), and 
high-bandwidth NIC to 
exfiltrate massive data 
volumes. 

C. Integrating Real-World Exploits (CVE/Zero-Day) 

To enhance the learning aspect, vulnerabilities should mirror real concepts: 

●​ CVE Simulation (Known Vulnerability): A mission target is running a specific virtual 

service version (e.g., FTP_Server_v1.0). The player must find or purchase a 
corresponding Exploit_Object for a publicly known vulnerability (like a simulated CVE). 
This teaches the importance of version control and patching. 

●​ Zero-Day Simulation (Dynamic/Unpatched): In high-tier missions, the target service is a 

custom version with a unique, hidden flaw (the "Zero-Day"). 

○​ The player cannot buy a module. They must use the fuzz or debug function on the 

target to analyze its behavior. 

○​ This analysis generates a specific Error Log Object in the NexusShell. 
○​ The player must then analyze the error log and write a completely new, custom 

NexusScript module designed specifically to exploit that single flaw, simulating the 
creation of a Zero-Day exploit code. 

This design ensures the game is simple to start (CLI basics), but quickly scales in complexity, 

requiring mastery of programming concepts and the simulated ethical hacking process to 
succeed. 

That's smart thinking. For a mobile-friendly game, keeping the syntax clean, using minimal 
special characters, and relying on spaces for separation is key for quick, comfortable input. 
Here is the revised design for NexusScript, tailored for simplicity and mobile typing, 
incorporating your syntax requirements. 

NexusScript Language Design (Mobile-Optimized) 

The core philosophy remains: Everything is an object, and every action is a 
function/method call. We'll use spaces to separate command components and dollars signs 
for variables. 

1. Core Syntax and Variable Handling 

The syntax is designed to mimic natural language commands while preserving the function of a 
command-line interface. 

Concept 
NexusScript Syntax 
Example 
Function / Mobile 
Benefit 

Command Structure [Function] [Target] 

[Parameters] 

scan target_ip subnet 
24 

Minimal special 
characters, separated 
by space. 

Variable Declaration 
set $[variable] = [value] set $router = new 

Router(21) 

Uses $ to easily denote 
a variable without 
complex symbols like 
% or #. 

String / Input 
Enclosed in quotes 
(standard) 

set $user = "admin" 
Standard string 
definition. 

Object Method Call 
$[Object].Method($[par
ams]) 

$router.connect($user 
$pass) 

Uses familiar dot 
notation, but uses a 
space, not a comma, to 
separate function 
arguments. 

Help System 
help [topic] 
help scan 
Simple, two-word 
command. 

2. Initial Core Commands and Objects 

This is the starting set available after the initial boot-up, focusing on local file system and basic 
network discovery. 

Command/Object 
Type 
NexusScript Syntax 
Example 

Learning Focus 

File Listing 
Command 
ls /v system 
Navigating the virtual 
file system. 

File Reading 
Command 
cat /v logs auth.log 
Reading data logs. 

Pinging 
Command 
ping 10 0 0 1 
Basic network 
connection check. 

Port Scanning 
Command 
scan 10 0 0 1 
Identifying open 
services. 

Command/Object 
Type 
NexusScript Syntax 
Example 

Learning Focus 

Variable Setting 
Command 
set $target = new IP 10 
0 0 1 

Creating an 
addressable object. 

Script Execution 
Command 
run my first script 
Running a 
player-created module. 

Basic Output 
Command 
print $target 
Displaying variable or 
object data. 

3. Simplified Scripting Structure (NexusScript Modules) 

Players write modules (functions) to automate sequences. The structure is simple, using bracket 
characters {} which are easily accessible on mobile keyboards. 

Concept 
NexusScript Syntax Example 
Function 

Function Definition 
func brute force v1 (target ip) 
Defines a reusable module. 
Arguments are separated by 
space. 

Control Flow (If) 
if target.port is open (21) { run 
ftp login $passfile } 

Conditional execution. The 
condition is wrapped in 
parentheses (). 

Looping 
for $line in $wordlist { print $line 
} 

Iterates over items. Requires 
minimal special characters. 

System Calls 
system sleep 5 
Executes system-level 
commands (e.g., to pause 
execution). 

Example: A Simple Brute-Force Module 

func simple brute (target ip) {​
    set $wordlist = cat /v data passwords.txt​
    ​
    # Iterate through the lines of the wordlist file​
    for $pass in $wordlist {​
        print "Attempting pass: $pass"​
        set $login_status = $target.login("admin" $pass)​
        ​
        # Check if the login was successful​
        if $login_status is TRUE {​
            print "SUCCESS password found: $pass"​
            system break # Exit loop early​
        }​
    }​
}​
​
# Run the script:​
run simple brute (10 0 0 5) ​
 

4. Advanced Tool and Object Design (Scaling) 

As the player levels up, new tool-objects are unlocked that leverage the simple syntax but 
perform complex actions. The complexity is encapsulated inside the function, not the syntax. 

Unlocked Tool-Object 
Method Call (Syntax) 
Real-World Concept Simulated 

Web Fuzzer 
$fuzzer.inject($target "SQL 
query" $payload) 

SQL Injection/Fuzzing: The 
player must provide the target, 
the method (type of attack), and 
the data ($payload) to test. 

Exploit Framework 
$cve.deploy($target "win server 
v2" $payload) 

Metasploit: The player uses 
the Exploit_Object ($cve) 
against a specific service 
version on the target. 

Packet Sniffer 
set $data = $nic.sniff(port 21 
duration 30) 

Wireshark/Packet Capture: 
Sniffs data for a set duration, 
then returns a Data Object 
($data) that requires a 
subsequent hashcrack 
command. 

Defense Firewall 
$firewall.rule add (ip $target 
action DROP) 

Rule Configuration: Used in 
defense missions or to secure 
the player's own VC, teaching 
firewall syntax. 

5. The Scaling help Command 

The help command automatically includes new usage examples and explains the underlying 
concept as commands are unlocked, functioning as the built-in curriculum. 

Advanced State Example (Post-Exploitation) 

> help $cve.deploy​
$cve.deploy​
Function: Deploys a loaded Exploit_Object against a specific target 
service. Requires a vulnerability ID (CVE Sim).​
Usage: $[Exploit_Object].deploy([target IP] [target OS] [payload 
module])​
Example: $exploit_v3.deploy($server "Linux Kernel 4.19" 
$shell_payload)​
Concept: Exploit Payloads and Targeting (similar to Metasploit).​
 
This design keeps the core scripting logic simple and easy to type, making it accessible on a 
mobile device, while reserving complexity for the logical structure of the player's modules and 
the strategic use of advanced, mission-unlocked objects.
